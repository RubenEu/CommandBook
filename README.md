# CommandBook
Plugin for Cuberite written in Lua.
It's in development. By the moment I'm trying new things and I will develop this "copying" plugins like Essentials(Bukkit) or CommandBook.

### Features (by the moment)
- Command /inventory <user> to inspect a inventory of other player and change it.

### Commands

| Command | Aliases | Permission | Permission (affects other players) | Description |

|/inventory | /invsee, /inv | cb.inventory | | Open the inventary of the other player.|
